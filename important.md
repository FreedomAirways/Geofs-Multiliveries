For those who don't know, there are now new rules for community modifications that include Multiliveries' code or assets. <br>


Firstly, and possibly one of the most important parts of this is our stance on copyright and usage.
**As an open-source and freeware plugin, Multiliveries' code may be used by anyone for anything** *(within legal boundaries)*.<br>
Our official texture maps made by either Spice9 or another developer or registered GitHub contributor are also free to use. <br>

Regarding our community provided material, we will allow the livery author to specify how any of his/her files may be used. <br>

I have surveyed the contributors in the Discord server, and they have so far specified the following in regards to usage of their assets:<br>


**air_george**: "As long as there is credit than everyone can use my livery. If you're talking about name then simply Air_George."<br>
> *(Free to use their livery so long as you credit them)*<br>

**luca b**: "As long as I'm credited, I'm fine with people flying them."<br>
> *(Free to use their livery so long as you credit them)*<br>

**Yair Galan**: "My livery can be used by anyone, as long as they know I made it."<br>
> *(Free to use their livery so long as you credit them)*<br>

**IUH Airways**: "idc who uses mine cuz mine is free for everyone!"<br>
> *(Free to use their livery so long as you credit them)*<br>

**coolpilot11**: "for my liveries submitted I don't believe I'm credited, but all liveries by me are mine, as long as nobody claims them as theirs, that's fine."<br>
> *(Free to use their livery so long as you credit them)*<br>

**AlexTheAvgeek**: "I only want them used in the ML addon under my name: AlexTheAvgeek"<br>
> *(Cannot be used outside of ML. Any community modifications must remove assets by this author.)*<br>

**If you are a contributor and wish to change your preferences or correct an error, then contact me and I will make the requested changes.**
