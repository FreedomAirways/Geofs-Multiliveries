# Geofs-Multiliveries
 This is an multiplayer addon created by Spice 9 dev for geofs. Right now this addon only supports liveries for our Boeing 737 Max 8 and airbus a320neo . Sadly multiplayer does not work on these new liveries since I can't figure that out but if any othere devs are interested to make it work that would be great. 

So in order to make this addon work you would have to copy the code and paste it on console (press ctrl+shift+i). For the liveries you have to scroll down till the bottom of the aircraft list. Here is the most important thing you have to use the TUI 737 max 8 inorder to make it work
